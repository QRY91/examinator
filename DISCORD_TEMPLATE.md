âš¡ **EXAMINATOR IS HERE** âš¡

Tired of failing exams? I built an exam-crushing toolkit that actually works.

ðŸŽ¯ **What it does:**
â€¢ Converts your PDFs â†’ Clean summaries  
â€¢ Generates practice questions automatically
â€¢ Interactive flashcard app (ADHD-friendly)
â€¢ Complete exam prep pipeline

ðŸš€ **Works in 4 commands:**
```bash
python3 ingest.py          # Process materials
python3 tidy.py --all      # Clean everything  
python3 refine.py          # Generate guides
python3 flashcards.py      # Study with spaced repetition
```

âœ¨ **Best part:** No AI needed - pure regex magic that works offline

ðŸŽ¬ **See it in action:** https://github.com/QRY91/examinator
(Click through the GIFs - installation takes 30 seconds)

Built this while cramming for security exam. Now sharing with fellow exam warriors ðŸ’ª

**Perfect for:** CS students, security certs, anyone drowning in PDFs
