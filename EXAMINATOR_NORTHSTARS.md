## üéØ Core Identity: The Knowledge Destruction Machine

**EXAMINATOR** is an offline-first, AI-assisted learning companion designed around the **"Stressed Student on a Bus"** constraint. By designing for the absolute worst-case learning scenario, we create tools that work excellently for everyone, everywhere, under any conditions.

### The Stressed Student on a Bus Constraint

**Primary Design Target**: Student cramming on public transport 2 hours before exam  
**Scenario Stack**:
- **Physical**: Cramped bus seat, bumpy ride, tiny phone screen, dying battery
- **Technical**: No internet, limited storage, maybe laptop + phone juggling
- **Cognitive**: Time pressure, anxiety, procrastination guilt, information overload
- **Social**: Crowded, noisy, can't spread out materials, distractions
- **Temporal**: Last-minute cramming, exam approaching, time scarcity

**Design Philosophy**: If it works for this scenario, it works for everyone.

## üß† Core Design Principles

### **1. Constraint-Driven Accessibility**
- **Worst-case optimization**: Design for stressed, mobile, offline, time-pressured users
- **Universal access**: Works on old phones, slow computers, unreliable connections
- **Crisis-proof learning**: Study materials available when you need them most
- **No-excuse functionality**: Never breaks when students are depending on it
- **Graceful degradation**: Always provides value even with limited resources

### **2. Offline-First Knowledge Architecture**
- **Complete independence**: Full functionality without internet connectivity
- **Intelligent caching**: Pre-load comprehensive materials during good connectivity
- **Local AI integration**: Mistral for immediate responses and drilling
- **Fusion mode**: Strategic cloud synthesis during connectivity windows
- **Knowledge sovereignty**: Students own their learning materials permanently

### **3. Mobile-Optimized Interaction Design**
- **Thumb-friendly**: All interactions work with one thumb on small screens
- **Short commands**: `examinator -c product` not complex multi-word options
- **Instant feedback**: SPACE bar reveals answers immediately
- **Portrait-mode TUI**: Interface works in phone orientation
- **Battery conscious**: Minimal resource usage for extended study sessions

### **4. Cognitive Load Reduction**
- **Clean, distraction-free interface**: Focus entirely on learning content
- **Progressive disclosure**: Show only what's needed for current task
- **Anxiety reduction**: Progress tracking, encouraging feedback, no judgment
- **Flow state protection**: No unexpected prompts, ads, or interruptions
- **Memory-friendly**: Build on existing patterns rather than forcing new ones

### **5. Educational Psychology Integration**
- **Spaced repetition**: Hard cards appear more frequently automatically
- **Active recall**: Always question ‚Üí think ‚Üí reveal answer flow
- **Confidence building**: Celebration of progress, not punishment for mistakes
- **ADHD-friendly**: Quick promotion but slow demotion of card difficulty
- **Intrinsic motivation**: Knowledge acquisition feels rewarding naturally

## üåä Fusion Mode: 100r-Inspired Hybrid Intelligence

### **Intermittent Connectivity Philosophy**
Inspired by Hundred Rabbits' decade of off-grid computing wisdom:
- **Connectivity as precious resource**: Optimize every byte of bandwidth
- **Batch operations**: Queue synthesis requests for uplink windows
- **Comprehensive caching**: "Gather copies of all online material we will need"
- **Graceful offline**: Primary functionality never depends on internet
- **Constraint weaponization**: Limited bandwidth ‚Üí thoughtful knowledge synthesis

### **Hybrid AI Architecture**
- **LOCAL (Mistral)**: Fast, available, good for drilling and iteration
- **CLOUD (Claude)**: Deep, synthesized, good for comprehensive understanding  
- **HUMAN (Student)**: Critical thinking, pattern recognition, knowledge internalization
- **Intelligent orchestration**: Right AI for right task at right time
- **Educational progression**: More independence over time, not more dependence

### **Bandwidth-Conscious Design**
- **The 100r Test**: Could this work on a sailboat with satellite internet?
- **The Rural School Test**: Could this work with monthly connectivity windows?
- **The Coffee Shop Test**: Could this work with brief WiFi access?
- **Educational value per MB**: Maximize learning impact per byte transferred
- **Sustainable synthesis**: Build knowledge bases that last offline

## üìö Content Generation Philosophy

### **Multi-Modal Learning Support**
- **Flashcards**: Quick drilling for factual recall and pattern recognition
- **Wiki synthesis**: Comprehensive knowledge bases for deep understanding
- **Comprehensive mode**: Both flashcards and wikis for complete coverage
- **Progressive complexity**: Build from simple facts to complex relationships
- **Context preservation**: Learning materials reference each other intelligently

### **Quality Over Quantity**
- **Deep synthesis**: Claude-generated wikis provide architectural understanding
- **Rapid iteration**: Mistral-generated flashcards for immediate feedback
- **Human validation**: Students verify and refine AI-generated content
- **Educational focus**: Every piece of content builds genuine understanding
- **Retention optimization**: Materials designed for long-term knowledge retention

### **Accessibility-First Content**
- **Mobile-readable**: All content works on small screens in poor lighting
- **Offline-complete**: No broken links or missing dependencies
- **Language-clear**: Complex concepts explained clearly without dumbing down
- **Progress-tracked**: Students always know where they are in learning journey
- **Transferable**: Learning patterns apply beyond specific subject matter
