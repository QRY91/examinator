- References to `{ProjectName}.Services` (doesn't exist by default)
- Complex authentication setup confusing for beginners
- Missing `app.MapRazorPages()` for Identity UI

**Fix Applied**:

- Added clear comments about optional vs required sections
- Included both simple and advanced Identity setup options
- Added `MapRazorPages()` for Identity UI to work
