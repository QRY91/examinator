## 🚀 **SETUP INSTRUCTIONS**

### **Step 1: Convert Assignment Materials (5 minutes)**
1. **Convert PDF**: Use your PDF conversion tools to create `assignment/VoorbeeldExamenCWeb2.md`
2. **Extract zips**: Unpack FundMvc and FundShared materials into `practice_materials/`
3. **Analyze requirements**: Create requirements breakdown in `assignment/requirements_analysis.md`

### **Step 2: Customize Templates (15 minutes)**
1. **Identify domain entities** from assignment requirements
2. **Adapt main templates** to assignment-specific domain
3. **Create solution_templates** with assignment entity names pre-filled
4. **Test template compilation** to ensure no syntax errors

### **Step 3: Practice Workflow (3 hours x 2-3 runs)**
1. **Full mock exam** under time pressure
2. **Document timing** and issues in practice_materials
3. **Refine approach** based on lessons learned
4. **Repeat until confident**

## ⏱️ **PRACTICE WORKFLOW**

### **Mock Exam Protocol**
```
1. SET ENVIRONMENT
   - Close all distractions
   - Set 3-hour timer
   - Have only assignment and templates available
   - Simulate exam conditions

2. READ ASSIGNMENT (10 minutes)
   - Read requirements completely twice
   - Identify entities and relationships
   - Plan approach using templates
   - Don't start coding yet

3. EXECUTE 45-90-45 TIMELINE
   Phase 1 (0-45min): Foundation setup
   Phase 2 (45-135min): Core CRUD implementation  
   Phase 3 (135-180min): Features and polish

4. DOCUMENT RESULTS
   - What worked well?
   - Where did you get stuck?
   - Time adjustments needed?
   - Template improvements?
```

### **Practice Runs Schedule**
- **Run 1**: Focus on completing basics, don't worry about time
- **Run 2**: Strict timing, document where you fall behind
- **Run 3**: Optimized approach based on lessons learned
- **Final Run**: Confidence builder, should feel smooth

## 🎯 **SUCCESS METRICS**

### **Practice Run Goals**
| Run | Time Goal | Completion Goal | Focus |
|-----|-----------|----------------|-------|
| **1** | No limit | Basic CRUD working | Learning assignment |
| **2** | 4 hours | Core features complete | Timing practice |
| **3** | 3.5 hours | All requirements met | Optimization |
| **Final** | 3 hours | Confident completion | Exam readiness |

### **Readiness Indicators**
- [ ] **Complete assignment in 3 hours** with systematic approach
- [ ] **Templates save significant time** vs writing from scratch
- [ ] **Comfortable with requirements analysis** process
- [ ] **Confident recovery** from common errors
- [ ] **Smooth template customization** workflow

## 🔧 **INTEGRATION WITH MAIN TEMPLATES**

### **Template Hierarchy**
```
main templates (generic) 
    ↓ customize for domain
solution_templates (assignment-specific)
    ↓ implement with timing
practice_runs (actual execution)
```

### **Customization Process**
1. **Copy main template**
2. **Replace generic entities** with assignment domain
3. **Add assignment-specific validation** rules
4. **Test compilation** before practice run
5. **Document customizations** for future reference

## 🚨 **COMMON PRACTICE SCENARIOS**

### **If You Finish Early (Under 2.5 hours)**
- Assignment was simpler than expected
- Templates are highly effective for this domain
- Good sign for exam readiness
- **Action**: Try more complex requirements or tighter constraints

### **If You Run Over Time (Over 3.5 hours)**
- Need template optimization or more practice
- Requirements analysis took too long
- Got stuck on technical issues
- **Action**: Focus practice on specific weak areas

### **If You Can't Complete Core Features**
- Templates may need more domain customization
- Requirements understanding needs work
- Basic technical skills need reinforcement
- **Action**: Practice individual components before full runs
