8. **What is an access modifier in C#**: An access modifier in C# determines the level of visibility and accessibility of classes, properties, or methods within a program.
9. **How can you create a new instance of the Category class**: A new instance of the Category class can be created using constructor initializers (e.g., `var myCategory = new Category { Id = 1, Name = "Electronics" };`).
10. **What are getters and setters in C#**: Getters and setters in C# are methods that allow retrieving (get) or modifying (set) property values of a class without exposing the underlying implementation details.

12. **What is the difference between public, private, and protected access modifiers in C#**: In C#, public access modifier allows access from any part of the application, private access modifier limits access to within the class, and protected access modifier restricts access to within the class and derived classes.
13. **What is a View in ASP.NET MVC**: In ASP.NET MVC, a View represents the user interface or presentation layer of an application, which displays data retrieved from the Model by the Controller.
14. **What is the function of the Controller in ASP.NET MVC**: The Controller in ASP.NET MVC handles incoming requests, processes data (including data validation and business logic), and decides on the appropriate Model or View to be used for the response.
