# üÉè Customer - LLM Generated Flashcards
*Generated from: Customer.cs*

1. **What is the primary data type of the CustomerId property**: It is an integer, used as a unique identifier for each customer.
2. **What does the ForeignKey attribute represent in the BrixelUserId property**: The ForeignKey attribute indicates that the BrixelUserId property has a foreign key relationship with another table (BrixelUser).
3. **What is the purpose of the string UserId property**: The UserId property stores the unique identifier for a user, although it's not explicitly clear from this code if it belongs to an external system or not.
4. **Why does the FirstName and LastName properties have data types of strings**: These properties store the customer's first name and last name as text (strings).
5. **What are the purposes of the BillingAddress, DeliveryAddress, and DeliveryMail properties**: The BillingAddress and DeliveryAddress properties store the respective addresses for billing and delivery purposes, while the DeliveryMail property stores the customer's email address for communication during deliveries.
6. **What does the EmailAddress attribute do on the DeliveryMail property**: The EmailAddress attribute is a validation rule that ensures the value entered in the DeliveryMail property follows a standard email format to improve data quality and help prevent common typos.
7. **What is the purpose of the BrixelUser property and its type**: The BrixelUser property represents the relationship between the Customer table and the BrixelUser table, with an optional nullable value (BrixelUser?). Its purpose is to link customer records to their corresponding user records in the BrixelUser table.
8. **What happens when the BrixelUserId property is set**: When the BrixelUserId property is set, it creates a relationship between the Customer record and its associated BrixelUser record by looking up the matching user in the BrixelUser table.
9. **How can you access the related BrixelUser object from the Customer class**: You can access the related BrixelUser object using the BrixelUser property of the Customer instance, as shown in the Customer class code: `public BrixelUser? BrixelUser { get; set; }`
10. **What is a nullable type, and why is BrixelUser marked as such**: A nullable type allows for storing values that can be `null`. In this case, the BrixelUser property is marked as nullable (BrixelUser?) because it's possible that some customers may not have an associated user in the BrixelUser table.
11. **What is the purpose of the namespace Webshop.MVC.Models**: The namespace `Webshop.MVC.Models` organizes the Customer class and other model classes (data representation objects) within the project, providing a clear separation between models, controllers, and views in the MVC architecture.
12. **What are DataAnnotations used for**: DataAnnotations are attributes applied to properties of data classes, such as the Customer class, to define validation rules, data conventions, and other metadata to improve data integrity and usability.
13. **What is the main purpose of the System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations namespace**: The `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` namespace provides attributes like Required, MaxLength, EmailAddress, etc., used for data validation and annotation within .NET applications.
14. **What does the Schema attribute do in the Customer class**: The [Schema] attribute is not used explicitly in this code snippet, but it is typically used to specify metadata information about database schema objects (e.g., tables, columns) when working with Entity Framework or other ORMs.
15. **What is the role of the using directives at the beginning of the code**: Using directives are lines that import required namespaces and make their classes, structures, interfaces, etc., available for use within the current namespace. In this case, the `using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` and `using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema` lines import the necessary namespaces to work with DataAnnotations and data schema information, respectively.
