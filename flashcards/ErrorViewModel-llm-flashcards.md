# üÉè Errorviewmodel - LLM Generated Flashcards
*Generated from: ErrorViewModel.cs*

1. **What does the 'ErrorViewModel' class represent in the given code**: This class is a model used within an MVC (Model-View-Controller) application, specifically for handling error responses or exceptions.
2. **What is the purpose of the 'RequestId' property in the ErrorViewModel class**: The 'RequestId' property in the ErrorViewModel class is intended to hold a unique identifier associated with a specific request made to the server, helping in debugging and troubleshooting purposes.
3. **What does the 'ShowRequestId' property do in the ErrorViewModel class**: The 'ShowRequestId' property in the ErrorViewModel class returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the 'RequestId' property has been set with a non-empty string.
4. **What is the role of the 'get; set;' syntax in C# properties like 'RequestId'**: In C#, the `get;` and `set;` keywords define accessors for properties. The `get;` keyword specifies a method that will be called when the property value is requested, while the `set;` keyword specifies a method that will be called when the property value is assigned.
5. **What does the '!' operator do in the 'ShowRequestId' property**: In C#, the `!` operator is a logical NOT operator that reverses the truth value of its operand. When applied to a nullable reference type like 'string?', it checks if the reference is null or empty ('null', '', nullable bools, etc.).
6. **What does the 'string.IsNullOrEmpty(RequestId)' expression do**: The `string.IsNullOrEmpty(RequestId)` expression in C# checks if the provided string (in this case, `RequestId`) is either null or an empty string (''). If it is, the expression returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
7. **What does the '?' symbol mean in the definition of the 'RequestId' property**: In C#, the `?` symbol is used to define a nullable reference type, which means that the property can hold null values as opposed to non-nullable types where null values are not allowed.
8. **What does the 'ShowRequestId' property return when the 'RequestId' property is empty or null**: The `ShowRequestId` property returns false when the `RequestId` property is either empty or null, because the logical NOT operator (`!`) reverses its truth value.
9. **What is the difference between a model and a view in an MVC application**: In an MVC (Model-View-Controller) application, a model represents the data and business logic of the application, while a view displays the user interface for interacting with the data. The controller acts as an intermediary, managing interactions between the model and the view.
10. **What is the role of the 'MVC' pattern in web development**: The MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern is used in web development to structure applications in a way that promotes separation of concerns, making it easier to maintain and scale web applications. The pattern divides an application into three main components: model, view, and controller.
11. **What is the purpose of a 'getter' method in C# properties**: In C# properties, a getter method is used to provide access to a property value. It is represented by the `get;` keyword and is automatically called when the property is accessed.
12. **What is the purpose of a 'setter' method in C# properties**: In C# properties, a setter method is used to modify the value of a property. It is represented by the `set;` keyword and is automatically called when the property is assigned a new value.
13. **What does the '?' symbol mean when used with a boolean in an if statement**: In an if statement, using the '?' symbol with a boolean expression means that the expression is being used as a conditional operator to return one of two possible results based on whether the condition is true or false.
14. **What is a nullable boolean and how is it declared in C#**: A nullable boolean is a boolean value that can hold the special value null, indicating an unknown or uninitialized state. In C#, nullable booleans are represented by the 'bool?' type.
15. **What does the ternary operator do in C#**: The ternary operator in C# (`condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse`) is used to evaluate an expression and return one of two possible results based on whether a condition is true or false. It provides a concise way to write if-else statements.
