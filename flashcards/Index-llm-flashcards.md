# 🃏 Index - LLM Generated Flashcards
*Generated from: Index.cshtml*

1. **What is the purpose of the Model in this code snippet**: The model in this code snippet represents a collection of `Product` objects that will be displayed in the view.

2. **What does the ViewData["Title"] = "Products"; statement do**: This statement sets the title of the page to "Products".

3. **What is the purpose of the Url.Action method in this code snippet**: The `Url.Action` method generates a URL for an action method in the controller.

4. **What does the h1 class="text-center mb-4">Product Index</h1> statement do**: This statement creates an h1 heading centered on the page with the text "Product Index".

5. **What is the function of the form in this code snippet**: The form allows users to filter and search the list of products based on various criteria like category, price range, and search string.

6. **What is the role of the ViewBag in this code**: The `ViewBag` is a dynamic object that can be used to pass data from the controller to the view without explicitly declaring properties on the model.

7. **Describe the function of the [hidden] input fields in the form**: These hidden input fields store and maintain the current state of filters, such as selected categories, price range, search string, and page number during form submission.

8. **What does the strong tag do in this code snippet**: The `strong` tag is used to make text bold, which helps to emphasize important information in this context - filtering options.

9. **What is the purpose of the foreach loop in the code snippet**: The `foreach` loop is used to iterate through a collection (categories) and generate checkboxes for each category in the view.

10. **What does the id attribute do in this code snippet**: The `id` attribute provides a unique identifier for an HTML element, which can be referenced by JavaScript or other parts of the code to manipulate the element.

11. **What is the purpose of the range input fields in the form**: The range input fields are used as sliders for filtering products based on their price range.

12. **Describe the role of the .row and .col-md-X classes in this code snippet**: The `.row` class is used to create a row layout, while the `.col-md-X` class is used to define columns within that row. These classes help to control the layout and arrangement of HTML elements on different screen sizes.

13. **What does the search-string-button class represent in this code snippet**: The `search-string-button` class represents a button used for searching products based on the entered search string and filtering options.

14. **What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption as demonstrated in this code snippet**: Symmetric encryption uses a single key for both encryption and decryption, while asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys - one public and one private. This means that symmetric encryption can be faster because it uses a shared secret key, but asymmetric encryption provides security without the need to share a secret key.

15. **What is the purpose of the price-range-slider and slider-values classes in this code snippet**: The `price-range-slider` class represents the container for the range input fields (sliders), while the `slider-values` class is used to display the current minimum and maximum prices selected by the user.
