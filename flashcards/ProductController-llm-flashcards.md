*Generated from: ProductController.cs*

1. **[The purpose of `IActionResult` in this code]**: This interface is used in ASP.NET Core MVC to represent the result of an action method. It allows for various types of responses such as views, redirects, and content-only results.

2. **[What is the role of `AsQueryable()` function called on `allProducts`]**: This function turns the collection into a queryable object, allowing further filtering without materialization. It enables deferred execution, which improves performance for large collections.

3. **[Explain `StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase`]**: This is an enumeration value that instructs string comparison methods to ignore case while comparing two strings. It is used to ensure that searches are not affected by the case of entered text.

4. **[What does the LINQ operator `Contains()` do in this code?]**: The `Contains()` method checks whether an element within a collection matches a specified value or expression. In this context, it is used to filter products based on category names and search strings.

5. **[Why are `selectedCategories`, `minPrice`, and `maxPrice` passed as lists instead of individual variables]**: Passing these parameters as lists allows the controller action to accept multiple values at once, making it more flexible and easier to manage complex filtering scenarios.

6. **[What is pagination and why is it used in this code]**: Pagination is a technique for breaking large amounts of data into smaller, more manageable chunks (pages). It improves performance by reducing the amount of data transferred at once, making it easier to handle and faster to load. In this example, pagination is applied to the filtered products list after filtering has taken place.

7. **[What does the LINQ operator `Skip()` do in this code?]**: The `Skip()` method skips a specified number of elements from the beginning of an enumerable sequence and returns the remaining elements. In this case, it is used for implementing pagination by skipping the appropriate number of products based on the current page.

8. **[What does the LINQ operator `Take()` do in this code?]**: The `Take()` method returns an enumerable sequence containing a specified number of elements from the beginning of an enumerable sequence and leaves the rest untouched. In this scenario, it is used to retrieve only the products for the current page.

9. **[What does the variable `pageSize` represent in this code]**: The `pageSize` variable represents the number of items that should be displayed per page in the product list view. This value is typically a configurable setting and can be adjusted to control the density of results.

10. **[What is the purpose of `ViewBag` in this code]**: `ViewBag` is used for storing data that needs to be passed from the controller to the view without explicitly creating a model class. It simplifies the process of sharing data between controller and view, making it easier to manage dynamic content.

11. **[What does the LINQ operator `Count()` do in this code?]**: The `Count()` method returns the number of elements in an enumerable sequence. In this example, it is used to calculate the total number of filtered products before applying pagination.

12. **[What is the purpose of `Math.Ceiling` in this code]**: The `Math.Ceiling()` function rounds a decimal value upwards to the nearest whole number. In this context, it is used to calculate the total number of pages required to display all filtered products based on the given `pageSize`.

13. **[What is the significance of `String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(searchString)` in this code]**: This check ensures that an empty string or a string containing only white spaces (spaces, tabs, line breaks, etc.) does not cause the product list to be filtered unnecessarily when searching for products.

14. **[What is the main advantage of using a repository pattern in this code]**: The repository pattern helps separate the data access logic from the business logic, making it easier to maintain and test the application. It also enables developers to switch data sources (e.g., database, REST API) without affecting the rest of the application.

15. **[What is the key difference between public and private keys in asymmetric encryption]**: In asymmetric encryption, public keys are used for encryption while private keys are used for decryption. This allows secure communication over untrusted networks as only the intended recipient can decrypt the message using their private key.
