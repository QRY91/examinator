*Generated from: Status.cs*

1. **What is the namespace 'Webshop.MVC.Models' used for**: It is a C# namespace that contains model classes for an MVC (Model-View-Controller) application.
2. **What is the purpose of the 'Status' class in this namespace**: The 'Status' class represents a status entity with two properties: Id and Name, typically used to represent various states or conditions within the Webshop application.
3. **What does the 'Id' property in the 'Status' class represent**: The 'Id' property is an integer that uniquely identifies each instance of the Status class within the application.
4. **What does the 'Name' property in the 'Status' class represent**: The 'Name' property represents a descriptive string associated with each instance of the Status class, typically used for user-friendly identification purposes.
5. **What is a Model in MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture**: In MVC, a Model is a representation of the data and business logic of an application. It contains data and defines methods to manipulate that data.
6. **How does the 'public' keyword modify the 'Id' property in the 'Status' class**: The 'public' keyword makes the Id property accessible from other parts of the code, allowing it to be read or modified as needed.
7. **What is encapsulation and how does it apply to the 'Status' class**: Encapsulation is a programming concept that binds the data and functions operating on the data together into a single unit. For the 'Status' class, this means that the properties (Id and Name) are bundled with their associated functionality, ensuring that they can only be accessed or modified through specified methods.
8. **What is polymorphism and how is it demonstrated by the 'Status' class**: Polymorphism is a programming concept where one entity can take on many forms. The 'Status' class demonstrates polymorphism because different instances of the Status class can represent various statuses, each with its unique Id and Name.
9. **What is inheritance and how does it apply to the 'Status' class**: Inheritance is a programming concept where a new class can be based on an existing class, inheriting its properties and methods. The 'Status' class does not directly demonstrate inheritance in this code snippet, but it could potentially inherit from a base class to share common functionality among multiple status types.
10. **What is the purpose of getting (get) and setting (set) keywords in the 'Id' and 'Name' properties**: The 'get' keyword defines a method that retrieves the current value of a property, while the 'set' keyword defines a method that sets or assigns a new value to a property. In the 'Status' class, these keywords ensure that the Id and Name values can be accessed and modified in a controlled manner.
11. **What is a namespace in C#**: A namespace is a container for related types (classes, interfaces, structures, enumerations, etc.) that organizes them to improve readability, reduce name collisions, and make it easier to navigate the codebase.
12. **What is an MVC architecture and why is it used**: MVC stands for Model-View-Controller architecture, a design pattern commonly used in software development to separate the presentation layer (View), business logic (Model), and control flow (Controller) of an application. It is used to improve maintainability, readability, and testability by separating these concerns.
13. **What does it mean for a property to be 'settable'**: A settable property means that its value can be changed or modified after being initially assigned. In the 'Status' class, both Id and Name properties are settable because they have associated 'set' methods to modify their values.
14. **What is a class in C#**: A class in C# is a blueprint or template for creating objects (also called instances). It defines the data (properties) and behavior (methods) that an object of that class will have when created.
15. **What is a property in C#**: In C#, a property is a named data member exposed by an object that may be read from or written to using a getter and setter method, respectively. Properties give the appearance of direct access to the underlying data while allowing control over how and when the data can be accessed or modified.
