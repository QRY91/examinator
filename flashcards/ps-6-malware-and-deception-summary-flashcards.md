# Ps 6 Malware And Deception Summary - Flashcards

- **malware**: Malicious software designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems.
- **a virus**: Malware that requires a host file and user action to spread. Attaches itself to executable files and spreads when infected files are shared.
- **a worm**: Self-replicating malware that spreads automatically across networks without user interaction. Can consume network bandwidth and system resources.
- **a Trojan horse**: Malware disguised as legitimate software that performs hidden malicious functions when executed by the user.
- **ransomware**: Malware that encrypts victim's files and demands payment (ransom) for the decryption key to restore access.
- **spyware**: Malware that secretly monitors user activity, collecting information like keystrokes, passwords, browsing habits, and personal data.
- **adware**: Software that displays unwanted advertisements, often bundled with legitimate programs. Can slow systems and track user behavior.
- **a rootkit**: Malware that modifies the operating system to hide its presence and maintain persistent access to the system.
- **a logic bomb**: Malicious code that remains dormant until triggered by a specific condition (date/time, user action, system event).
- **a backdoor**: Hidden method of bypassing normal authentication to gain system access, often installed by other malware.
- **a botnet**: Network of infected computers (bots/zombies) controlled remotely by cybercriminals for coordinated attacks.
- **browser hijacking**: Malware that modifies web browser settings to redirect users to malicious websites or display unwanted ads.
- **keylogging**: Recording keystroke data to capture sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, and personal data.
- **phishing**: Fraudulent emails/websites impersonating legitimate entities to steal sensitive information like credentials or financial data.
- **spear phishing**: Targeted phishing attacks directed at specific individuals or organizations using personalized information.
- **whaling**: Phishing attacks specifically targeting high-profile individuals like executives or celebrities.
- **vishing**: Voice phishing - social engineering attacks conducted over the phone to extract sensitive information.
- **pretexting**: Creating fabricated scenarios to build trust and convince victims to reveal information or perform actions.
- **baiting**: Offering something enticing (free USB, download) that contains malware or leads to system compromise.
- **shoulder surfing**: Observing someone enter passwords, PINs, or sensitive information by looking over their shoulder.
- **dumpster diving**: Searching through trash to find documents containing sensitive information like passwords or personal data.
- **How is malware commonly distributed**: Email attachments, infected websites, malicious downloads, USB drives, software vulnerabilities, and social engineering.
- **drive-by downloads**: Automatic malware downloads that occur when visiting compromised websites, often without user knowledge.
- **a watering hole attack**: Compromising websites frequently visited by target organizations to infect visitors with malware.
- **software vulnerabilities**: Security flaws in programs that malware can exploit to gain system access without user interaction.
- **How can you protect against malware**: Use antivirus software, keep systems updated, avoid suspicious emails/links, use firewalls, backup data regularly.
- **sandboxing**: Running suspicious programs in isolated environments to analyze behavior without risking the main system.
- **indicators of compromise (IoCs)**: Evidence that a system has been breached, such as unusual network traffic, file changes, or system behavior.
- **How do you respond to malware infection**: Isolate system, identify malware type, remove infection, restore from backups, update security measures, document incident.
- **defense in depth for malware protection**: Using multiple security layers: endpoint protection, network security, user training, access controls, and monitoring.
- **behavioral analysis**: Monitoring program behavior to detect malicious activities rather than relying solely on signature-based detection.
- **the importance of regular backups**: Backups allow system restoration if infected by ransomware or destructive malware, reducing impact of attacks.
