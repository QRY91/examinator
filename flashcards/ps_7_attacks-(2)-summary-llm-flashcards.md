# üÉè Ps 7 Attacks (2) Summary - LLM Generated Flashcards
*Generated from: ps_7_attacks-(2)-summary.md*

1. **What is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack**: An attack that makes a system or network resource unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic or requests.

2. **What is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack**: A DoS attack using multiple compromised systems (botnet) to flood the target with traffic from many sources.

3. **What is ARP poisoning/spoofing**: Attack that associates the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of another host, redirecting network traffic through the attacker.

4. **What is DNS poisoning**: Corrupting DNS cache data to redirect domain name queries to malicious IP addresses instead of legitimate ones.

5. **What is a replay attack**: Intercepting and retransmitting valid network communications to gain unauthorized access or repeat transactions.

6. **What is IP spoofing**: Forging the source IP address in packets to impersonate another system and bypass security controls.

7. **What is a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack**: Intercepting and potentially altering communications between two parties who believe they're communicating directly.

8. **What are the main weaknesses of WEP**: Static encryption keys, weak 24-bit initialization vector (IV), and RC4 stream cipher vulnerabilities.

9. **What improvements does WPA2 provide over WEP**: Uses AES encryption, dynamic key generation per packet, and stronger authentication methods.

10. **What is a rogue access point**: Unauthorized wireless access point that can intercept wireless communications or provide network access to attackers.

11. **What is wardriving**: Searching for wireless networks while driving around to find unsecured or vulnerable access points.

12. **What is MAC address spoofing**: Changing a device's MAC address to impersonate another device and bypass MAC address filtering.

13. **What is SQL injection**: Inserting malicious SQL code into application queries to access, modify, or delete database information.

14. **How can you prevent SQL injection**: Use parameterized queries/prepared statements, input validation, and principle of least privilege for database accounts.

15. **What is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Injecting malicious scripts into web pages that execute in other users' browsers to steal data or hijack sessions.
