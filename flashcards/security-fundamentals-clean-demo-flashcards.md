# Security Fundamentals Clean Demo - Flashcards

- **What does CIA stand for in cybersecurity?**: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability - the three fundamental principles of information security.
- **Define Confidentiality in the CIA Triad**: Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to access it. Prevents unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.
- **Define Integrity in the CIA Triad**: Ensuring that information is accurate, complete, and has not been modified by unauthorized parties.
- **Define Availability in the CIA Triad**: Ensuring that information and systems are accessible when needed by authorized users.
- **the difference between authentication and authorization**: Authentication verifies WHO you are (identity verification), while authorization determines WHAT you can access (permission control).
- **the main difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption**: Symmetric uses the same key for encryption/decryption (faster, shared secret), while asymmetric uses different keys - public/private key pairs (slower, no shared secret needed).
- **RSA and what is it used for**: RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm using public/private key pairs. Used for secure key exchange, digital signatures, and encrypting small amounts of data.
- **AES**: Advanced Encryption Standard - a symmetric encryption algorithm that's fast and secure. Uses 128, 192, or 256-bit keys.
- **hashing and how is it different from encryption**: Hashing is a one-way function that creates a fixed-size digest from input data. Unlike encryption, it cannot be reversed - used for data integrity verification.
- **HMAC**: Hash-based Message Authentication Code - combines a hash function with a secret key to provide both data integrity and authentication.
- **a firewall**: A network security device that monitors and controls incoming/outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
- **the difference between HTTP and HTTPS**: HTTPS (HTTP Secure) adds TLS/SSL encryption to HTTP, protecting data in transit between client and server.
- **a VPN**: Virtual Private Network - creates a secure, encrypted tunnel over the internet for private communication.
- **phishing**: A social engineering attack using fake emails, websites, or messages to trick users into revealing sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers.
- **SQL injection**: A web application attack where malicious SQL code is inserted into application queries, potentially allowing attackers to access/modify database data.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: A web vulnerability where attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially stealing data or hijacking sessions.
- **a man-in-the-middle attack**: An attack where the attacker intercepts and potentially alters communications between two parties who believe they're communicating directly.
- **a virus vs. a worm**: A virus requires a host file and user action to spread, while a worm can replicate and spread automatically across networks without user interaction.
- **ransomware**: Malware that encrypts victim's files and demands payment (ransom) for the decryption key.
- **a Trojan horse**: Malware disguised as legitimate software that performs hidden malicious functions when executed.
- **the principle of least privilege**: Users should be given the minimum levels of access necessary to perform their job functions - nothing more.
- **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**: Security method requiring two or more verification factors: something you know (password), something you have (token), something you are (biometric).
- **role-based access control (RBAC)**: Access control method where permissions are assigned to roles, and users are assigned to roles based on their job functions.
- **the four main phases of incident response**: 1) Preparation, 2) Detection & Analysis, 3) Containment, Eradication & Recovery, 4) Post-Incident Activity/Lessons Learned.
- **What should be the first priority during a security incident?**: Containment - prevent the incident from spreading or causing further damage while preserving evidence.
- **data anonymization**: The process of removing or altering personally identifiable information so individuals cannot be identified from the dataset.
- **k-anonymity**: A privacy preservation technique ensuring each record is indistinguishable from at least k-1 other records based on quasi-identifiers.
