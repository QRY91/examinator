# Ch3 Encryption - Study Guide

## Cryptography & Encryption
- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: Most widely used, 128/192/256-bit
- **DES (Data Encryption Standard)**: Legacy 56-bit encryption, now
- **3DES (Triple DES)**: Applies DES three times, more secure but slower than AES
- **Block vs S**: Block ciphers encrypt fixed-size chunks, stream ciphers encrypt bit-by-
- **Same K**: Uses identical key for encryption
- **RSA**: Most common public-key algorithm, based on
- **ECC (Elliptic Curve)**: More efficient than RSA, smaller key sizes for
- **Diffie-H**: Key exchange protocol for secure
- **Key P**: Public key (shareable) and private key (secret)
- **SHA-256**: Secure Hash Algorithm, produces 256-
- **MD5**: Legacy hash function, now vulnerable
- **HMAC**: Hash-based Message Authentication Code for
- **Key G**: Using cryptographically secure random
- **Key D**: Secure methods for sharing
- **Key S**: Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) and secure
- **Key R**: Regular changing of encryption keys
- **Key E**: Backup key storage for
- **HTTPS/TLS**: Web traffic encryption using certificates and public
- **VPN**: Virtual Private Networks encrypting
- **Brute F**: Trying all possible keys until correct
- **Dictionary A**: Using common passwords/keys
- **Rainbow T**: Precomputed hash lookups for
- **Perfect Forward S**: Session keys not compromised if long-term keys
- **Crypto A**: Ability to quickly change algorithms when
- **Regular U**: Keeping cryptographic libraries and
- **Quantum Key D**: Using quantum mechanics for ultra-secure
- **NIST S**: New cryptographic standards being developed for

## General Security
- **Full Disk E**: BitLocker, FileVault protecting data
- **Strong K**: Sufficient length and randomness for
- **Implementation S**: Proper coding to avoid timing attacks and
- **Post-Quantum C**: Algorithms resistant to quantum
- **Quantum T**: Future quantum computers breaking current public-

## Malware & Threats
- **Side-C**: Exploiting physical
