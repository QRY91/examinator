## üè¢ Practical Scenarios

**Scenario 1: The Ransomware Attack on the Accounting Department**

A mysterious email was sent to the accounting department, seemingly from the CEO. It contained an invoice attachment titled "Financial Report Q2.xls." One of the accountants, not suspecting anything unusual, opened the attachment and unknowingly downloaded a ransomware Trojan horse onto their workstation. The ransomware quickly spread to other accounting machines through network sharing and a company-wide file server.

**Your Task:** Investigate the origin of the email and identify the malware type that was introduced in the department. Recommend immediate remediation steps, including data recovery options.

**Key Considerations:** Malware types (ransomware, Trojan horse), email security (phishing), network security (virus, worm, botnet), data protection (data backup and recovery).

**Scenario 2: The Disappearing Server**

The IT department has noticed a dramatic decrease in the performance of the company's main server. After checking the system logs, they discovered a large amount of outgoing network traffic originating from the machine. Further investigation revealed that the server had been taken over by a botnet and was now being used to send spam emails and attacks other networks.

**Your Task:** Identify the malware type responsible for the botnet infection, locate its point of entry, and recommend steps to remove it and secure the network against future attacks.

**Key Considerations:** Malware types (worm, backdoor, Trojan horse), network security (botnets, browser hijacking), system monitoring (log analysis), incident response (remediation).

**Scenario 3: The Executive's Compromised Account**

An executive at the company received an unexpected call from someone claiming to be a tech support representative. The caller informed them that their computer had been compromised and requested remote access to fix the issue. After granting permission, the executive noticed unusual activity on their workstation, including strange files and applications appearing, as well as sluggish performance.

**Your Task:** Identify the malware type used in this attack (vishing) and recommend steps to secure the executive's account and prevent future unauthorized access.

**Key Considerations:** Social engineering & deception (pretexting, vishing), account security (strong passwords, multi-factor authentication), incident response (remediation, user education).
