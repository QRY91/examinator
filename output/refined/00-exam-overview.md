# 🎯 Privacy & Security Exam - Complete Prep Guide

## 📋 Exam Structure
- **Duration**: 3 hours
- **Format**: Open questions + Practical exercises
- **Materials**: Calculator, laptop, internet, course materials allowed
- **Sections**: Theory questions + Hands-on problems

## 🎪 Question Types Analysis
Based on the mock exam, expect these question patterns:

### 1. Conceptual Explanations
- Define concepts clearly and completely
- Compare/contrast related concepts (e.g., XSS types)
- Explain processes step-by-step (e.g., HMAC, incident response)

### 2. Real-world Applications
- Security models in business contexts
- Attack scenarios and defenses
- Privacy protection techniques

### 3. Hands-on Problem Solving
- XSS attack construction and mitigation
- Data anonymization exercises
- Cryptographic implementations

## 🚀 Study Strategy
1. **Master the fundamentals** (CIA triad, security models)
2. **Practice explanations** - explain concepts out loud
3. **Draw diagrams** for complex models (Bell LaPadula)
4. **Hands-on practice** with XSS, anonymization
5. **Create examples** for each major concept
