1. **What does CIA stand for in cybersecurity?**: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability - the three fundamental principles of information security.

2. **Define Confidentiality in the CIA Triad**: Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to access it. Prevents unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.

3. **What is the difference between authentication and authorization?**: Authentication verifies WHO you are (identity verification), while authorization determines WHAT you can access (permission control).

4. **What is RSA and what is it used for?**: RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm using public/private key pairs. Used for secure key exchange, digital signatures, and encrypting small amounts of data.

5. **What is HMAC and how is it different from hashing?**: Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) combines a hash function with a secret key to provide both data integrity and authentication. Unlike hashing, it cannot be used for encryption as it can't be reversed - instead, it is used for data integrity verification and authentication.
