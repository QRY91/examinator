## üìù Multiple Choice Questions

**Question 1:**
In a scenario where an organization stores its sensitive data in a cloud service, which of the following measures would best ensure the integrity of this data?

A) Regularly backing up the data but not encrypting it
B) Encrypting the data but not monitoring for unauthorized access attempts
C) Using strong passwords to protect data storage access
D) Implementing a system that generates alerts when data is modified and logs all modifications for review
**Answer:** D
Explanation: Integrity involves ensuring that information is accurate, complete, and has not been modified by unauthorized parties. Option D provides mechanisms for detecting unauthorized modifications, maintaining data integrity.

**Question 2:**
Consider a secure messaging application that allows users to communicate privately. Which encryption type would be best suited for this purpose?

A) Symmetric encryption with the same key used for both sender and receiver
B) Asymmetric encryption using different keys for each user
C) Hashing, as it ensures data integrity but does not encrypt messages
D) AES, a symmetric encryption algorithm with 128-bit keys
**Answer:** B
Explanation: Since users may not share a secret key beforehand, asymmetric encryption using public/private key pairs (option B) is the best choice for secure messaging applications.

**Question 3:**
During an internal audit, it was discovered that a web application has been compromised due to SQL injection attacks. Which of the following strategies should be implemented first to mitigate this issue?

A) Update the web application with the latest security patches
B) Change all user account passwords immediately
C) Implement WAF (Web Application Firewall) rules to prevent SQL injection attacks
D) Isolate the affected web application from the rest of the network until a thorough investigation is completed
**Answer:** A, C, and D
Explanation: To mitigate an SQL injection attack, applying security patches (option A), implementing WAF rules (option C), and isolating the affected application (option D) are all important steps.

**Question 4:**
You are a network administrator at a company that uses VPNs for remote access by employees. Which of the following situations would be a potential security risk when using this service?

A) An employee connecting to the VPN from an insecure public Wi-Fi network
B) Employees sharing their VPN login credentials with each other
C) Using weak passwords for VPN authentication
D) Allowing employees to use personal devices for remote access without proper security measures
**Answer:** A, B, and D
Explanation: An insecure public Wi-Fi network (option A), sharing VPN login credentials (option B), and allowing unsecured personal devices for remote access (option D) all pose potential security risks when using a VPN.

**Question 5:**
Suppose an attacker intercepts data in transit between a user's computer and a server, performing a man-in-the-middle attack. Which protocol could prevent this kind of attack?

A) HTTPS (HTTP Secure)
B) FTP
C) SSH
D) SMTP
**Answer:** A
Explanation: HTTPS adds TLS/SSL encryption to HTTP, protecting data in transit between the client and server. This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks by encrypting the communication channel. Other protocols like FTP, SSH, or SMTP do not offer this level of protection by default.
