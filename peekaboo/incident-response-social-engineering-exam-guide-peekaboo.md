<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

1) Preparation, 2) Detection & Analysis, 3) Containment, Eradication & Recovery, 4) Post-Incident Activity (Lessons Learned).

</details>

**What happens during the Preparation phase?**
<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

Establish incident response team, create policies/procedures, set up communication channels, acquire tools, conduct training, and develop incident classification criteria.

</details>

**What happens during Detection & Analysis?**
<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

Monitor systems for signs of incidents, analyze alerts, determine scope and impact, document evidence, and classify the incident severity.

</details>

**What happens during Containment, Eradication & Recovery?**
<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

Contain the incident to prevent spread, eliminate the threat, restore systems to normal operations, and implement additional safeguards.

</details>

**What happens during Post-Incident Activity?**
<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

Document lessons learned, update procedures, conduct post-mortem analysis, improve detection capabilities, and provide feedback to stakeholders.

</details>

### Social Engineering Attacks
**What should be the first priority during an incident?**
<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

Containment - prevent the incident from spreading while preserving evidence for investigation.

</details>

**What is social engineering?**
<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

Psychological manipulation techniques used to trick people into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security.

</details>

**What is phishing?**
<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

Fraudulent emails, websites, or messages designed to steal sensitive information like usernames, passwords, or credit card details by impersonating legitimate entities.

</details>

**What is spear phishing?**
<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

Targeted phishing attacks directed at specific individuals or organizations, using personalized information to increase credibility and success rate.

</details>

**What is whaling?**
<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

Phishing attacks specifically targeting high-profile individuals like executives, politicians, or celebrities (the "big fish").

</details>

**What is vishing?**
<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

Voice phishing - social engineering attacks conducted over the phone to extract sensitive information or convince victims to perform certain actions.

</details>

### Social Engineering Techniques
**What is pretexting?**
<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

Creating a fabricated scenario (pretext) to engage victims and gain their trust before requesting sensitive information or access.

</details>

**What is baiting in social engineering?**
<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

Offering something enticing (like a free USB drive or download) that contains malware or leads to a compromise when accessed.

</details>

**What is tailgating/piggybacking?**
<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

Following an authorized person into a restricted area without proper authentication, exploiting human courtesy.

</details>

**What is quid pro quo?**
<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

Offering a service or benefit in exchange for information or access, like fake IT support calls.

</details>

### Defense Against Social Engineering
**What psychological principles do social engineers exploit?**
<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

1) Authority (impersonating figures of authority), 2) Urgency (creating time pressure), 3) Social proof (claiming others have complied), 4) Reciprocity (offering help first).

</details>

**How can organizations defend against social engineering?**
<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

1) Security awareness training, 2) Clear policies and procedures, 3) Verification protocols, 4) Technical controls (email filtering), 5) Regular phishing simulations.

</details>

**What are red flags of phishing emails?**
<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

1) Urgent/threatening language, 2) Generic greetings, 3) Suspicious links/attachments, 4) Grammar/spelling errors, 5) Requests for sensitive information, 6) Mismatched sender addresses.

</details>

### Incident Classification
**What should users do if they suspect a social engineering attempt?**
<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

1) Don't provide information, 2) Verify through independent channels, 3) Report to security team, 4) Document the attempt, 5) Warn colleagues if appropriate.

</details>

**How are security incidents typically classified?**
<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

By severity levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical) based on factors like business impact, data sensitivity, system criticality, and potential for spread.

</details>

**What information should be documented during an incident?**
<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

Timeline of events, affected systems, actions taken, evidence collected, impact assessment, root cause, and lessons learned.

</details>

## ðŸ’¡ Study Tips
**What is the difference between an incident and an event?**
<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

An event is any observable occurrence in a system/network. An incident is an event that violates security policies or threatens the organization. - Practice identifying social engineering techniques in scenarios - Memorize the incident response phases and key activities - Learn to recognize phishing email characteristics - Understand the psychology behind social engineering attacks - Practice incident documentation and communication procedures
