3. Social engineering attack vectors and countermeasures

## ðŸ“š Key Concepts & Definitions

### Incident Response Process

**Q: What are the four main phases of incident response?**
A: 1) Preparation, 2) Detection & Analysis, 3) Containment, Eradication & Recovery, 4) Post-Incident Activity (Lessons Learned).

**Q: What happens during the Preparation phase?**
A: Establish incident response team, create policies/procedures, set up communication channels, acquire tools, conduct training, and develop incident classification criteria.

**Q: What happens during Detection & Analysis?**
A: Monitor systems for signs of incidents, analyze alerts, determine scope and impact, document evidence, and classify the incident severity.

**Q: What happens during Containment, Eradication & Recovery?**
A: Contain the incident to prevent spread, eliminate the threat, restore systems to normal operations, and implement additional safeguards.

**Q: What happens during Post-Incident Activity?**
A: Document lessons learned, update procedures, conduct post-mortem analysis, improve detection capabilities, and provide feedback to stakeholders.

**Q: What should be the first priority during an incident?**
A: Containment - prevent the incident from spreading while preserving evidence for investigation.

### Social Engineering Attacks

**Q: What is social engineering?**
A: Psychological manipulation techniques used to trick people into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security.

**Q: What is phishing?**
A: Fraudulent emails, websites, or messages designed to steal sensitive information like usernames, passwords, or credit card details by impersonating legitimate entities.

**Q: What is spear phishing?**
A: Targeted phishing attacks directed at specific individuals or organizations, using personalized information to increase credibility and success rate.

**Q: What is whaling?**
A: Phishing attacks specifically targeting high-profile individuals like executives, politicians, or celebrities (the "big fish").

**Q: What is vishing?**
A: Voice phishing - social engineering attacks conducted over the phone to extract sensitive information or convince victims to perform certain actions.

**Q: What is pretexting?**
A: Creating a fabricated scenario (pretext) to engage victims and gain their trust before requesting sensitive information or access.

### Social Engineering Techniques

**Q: What is baiting in social engineering?**
A: Offering something enticing (like a free USB drive or download) that contains malware or leads to a compromise when accessed.

**Q: What is tailgating/piggybacking?**
A: Following an authorized person into a restricted area without proper authentication, exploiting human courtesy.

**Q: What is quid pro quo?**
A: Offering a service or benefit in exchange for information or access, like fake IT support calls.

**Q: What psychological principles do social engineers exploit?**
A: 1) Authority (impersonating figures of authority), 2) Urgency (creating time pressure), 3) Social proof (claiming others have complied), 4) Reciprocity (offering help first).

### Defense Against Social Engineering

**Q: How can organizations defend against social engineering?**
A: 1) Security awareness training, 2) Clear policies and procedures, 3) Verification protocols, 4) Technical controls (email filtering), 5) Regular phishing simulations.

**Q: What are red flags of phishing emails?**
A: 1) Urgent/threatening language, 2) Generic greetings, 3) Suspicious links/attachments, 4) Grammar/spelling errors, 5) Requests for sensitive information, 6) Mismatched sender addresses.

**Q: What should users do if they suspect a social engineering attempt?**
A: 1) Don't provide information, 2) Verify through independent channels, 3) Report to security team, 4) Document the attempt, 5) Warn colleagues if appropriate.

### Incident Classification

**Q: How are security incidents typically classified?**
A: By severity levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical) based on factors like business impact, data sensitivity, system criticality, and potential for spread.

**Q: What information should be documented during an incident?**
A: Timeline of events, affected systems, actions taken, evidence collected, impact assessment, root cause, and lessons learned.

**Q: What is the difference between an incident and an event?**
A: An event is any observable occurrence in a system/network. An incident is an event that violates security policies or threatens the organization.
