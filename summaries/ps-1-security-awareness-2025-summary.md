*Generated from: PS_1_Security Awareness_2025.pdf*

**Q: What is cybersecurity?**
A: Cybersecurity refers to a set of techniques used to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of networks, programs, and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access.

**Q: List different types of cybersecurity protections.**
A: Network security, application security, information security, operational security, disaster recovery and continuity, and user training.

**Q: Why is cybersecurity important?**
A: Cybersecurity helps prevent data loss or corruption, loss of access to services or accounts, loss of online credits or money, identity theft, threats to internet services, threats to key industry sectors, and threats to people's way of life.

**Q: What is the difference between personal identity and corporate identity?**
A: Personal identity refers to a person's identification details such as their name, social security number, and financial information. Corporate identity, on the other hand, refers to a company's unique name, trademarks, logos, and other elements that make it recognizable.

**Q: Why is cybersecurity important for businesses?**
A: Businesses need cybersecurity because an internet connection can be a point of attack, online stores require protection, employees can unknowingly pose a risk to attacks, protocols and measures within the company are necessary for prevention, and the responsibility for the security of the business lies with the employee.

**Q: What are some good prevention measures in cybersecurity?**
A: Having a clear policy, enforcing the policy consistently, using unique passwords, generating random passwords or combinations of random words, using a good password manager (multi-platform, zero-knowledge, auto-renew), enabling two-factor authentication, locking devices at all times, using good encryption on all sensitive data, and applying updates regularly.

**Q: What is the GDPR?**
A: The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulation that covers all data controllers and subjects based in the European Union. It applies to organizations based outside the EU that process the personal data of its residents.

**Q: What is the advantage of an attacker in a cybersecurity context?**
A: An attacker has several advantages, such as only needing one successful attack, choosing a specific spot within the system to attack, having the zero-day advantage, playing dirty, requiring the defense to always work, defending the entire system, defending against known attacks only, and needing to comply with the law.

**Q: Why are old exploits still dangerous in cybersecurity?**
A: Old exploits remain dangerous because some are not or are late patched, not all systems have the latest update installed to prevent misuse of old exploits, and many businesses only pay attention to weaknesses in their system after they have been attacked.

**Q: Why is it important to use good encryption in cybersecurity?**
A: It's important to use good encryption because sensitive data needs protection from unauthorized access, and encryption provides confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the data.

**Q: What is a zero-day advantage in cybersecurity?**
A: A zero-day advantage refers to an attacker exploiting a vulnerability or flaw in a system for which no fix or patch has been released by the software vendor.

**Q: Why should devices be locked at all times in cybersecurity?**
A: Devices should be locked at all times because it prevents unauthorized access, helping to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data stored on the device.

**Q: What is two-factor authentication in cybersecurity?**
A: Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security mechanism that requires users to provide two different types of identification before they can log in or access a system. Common factors include something you know (password), something you have (a physical token or mobile app), and something you are (biometrics).

**Q: What is the purpose of disaster recovery and continuity in cybersecurity?**
A: Disaster recovery and continuity aim to ensure that a business can continue operating after a disaster, such as a cyber attack, natural disaster, or system failure. This involves having backup systems, data storage, and procedures in place to quickly restore operations and minimize downtime.

**Q: What is the difference between confidentiality, integrity, and availability in cybersecurity?**
A: Confidentiality refers to protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access. Integrity refers to maintaining the accuracy and trustworthiness of data over its entire lifecycle. Availability refers to ensuring that systems, services, and data are accessible and usable when needed by authorized users.
