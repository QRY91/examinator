**Q: What does MFA stand for in the context of cybersecurity?**
A: MFA stands for Multifactor Authentication, a method to prove one's identity by using more than one factor or method.

**Q: Explain what two-factor authentication (2FA) is and why it is beneficial for security.**
A: Two-Factor Authentication is a type of MFA that requires users to provide two different authentication factors, such as a password and a verification code sent via email or SMS. This makes the authentication process stronger because an attacker would need both factors to gain unauthorized access.

**Q: List some common examples of multifactor authentication.**
A: Common examples of MFA include PIN + bank card, code via email or SMS + password, RSA token + password, and others.

**Q: What are the possible factors for multifactor authentication?**
A: The possible factors for MFA can be something you know (such as a password), something you have (like a security token), something you are (biometric data), where you are (geolocation or IP address), and when you request access (time).

**Q: Define behavior authentication.**
A: Behavior authentication is the process of verifying users based on their actions, such as who they communicate with, which websites they visit, and how they interact with the system. It does not mean the same as behavioral authentication but makes use of machine learning for evaluation.

**Q: Explain continuous authentication.**
A: Continuous authentication refers to the ongoing authentication of users during their interaction with a system, rather than only at login. This method is used in behavior authentication and helps protect against unauthorized access by monitoring user behavior and reporting any irregularities.

**Q: What is biometric authentication?**
A: Biometric authentication uses unique physical characteristics to authenticate users, such as voice recognition, face recognition, fingerprint scans, eye scans, or keystroke analysis. This type of authentication is based on the "something that you are" factor.

**Q: Give some examples of behavioral authentication.**
A: Examples of behavioral authentication include voice recognition, face recognition, fingerprint scans, eye scans, and keystroke authentication.

**Q: Explain machine learning in the context of cybersecurity.**
A: Machine learning is a process that involves training statistical models to make decisions based on data. In the context of behavior or behavioral authentication, it is used to analyze user behavior patterns for identifying irregularities and ensuring secure access.

**Q: What is raw input in machine learning?**
A: Raw input refers to the original, unprocessed data collected by sensors, such as a photo of a face, an audio fragment, or a vibration reading.

**Q: Define pre-processing.**
A: Pre-processing is the stage in machine learning that ensures the data is usable by filtering out any incorrect measurements or noisy data, like removing a photo with a spot or eliminating an audio fragment with excessive noise.

**Q: What is feature extraction?**
A: Feature extraction is the process of converting raw input data into a format that the model or computer can understand, creating a feature vector or array filled with computable data representing the data.

**Q: What are feature vectors and why are they important in machine learning?**
A: Feature vectors are arrays containing computable data describing the raw input data, making it easier for models to make decisions based on the processed information. They are essential in machine learning as they allow models to understand the underlying patterns and structure of the data.

**Q: How does training a model work in machine learning?**
A: Training a model in machine learning involves feeding the model with large amounts of labeled data so it can learn to recognize patterns, make predictions, or classify new inputs accurately. The model is trained by adjusting its internal parameters based on the feedback from the provided data until it achieves satisfactory results.

**Q: What is an advantage of using machine learning in cybersecurity?**
A: Using machine learning in cybersecurity provides a more efficient and accurate way to detect anomalies, patterns, or threats that might not be apparent with traditional methods. This helps improve system security by enabling proactive measures against potential attacks.
