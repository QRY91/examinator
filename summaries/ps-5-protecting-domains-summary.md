**Q: What are the three types of access control discussed in this study material?**
A: The three types of access control discussed in this study material are Mandatory Access Control (MAC), Discretionary Access Control (DAC), and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

**Q: How does Mandatory Access Control work?**
A: Mandatory Access Control restricts actions that a person or process can perform on an object, such as a file, port, or input/output device. It uses an authorization rule to determine if a subject has access to the object. For example, only those with top secret security clearance may view a top secret file.

**Q: What is Discretionary Access Control?**
A: Discretionary Access Control gives or limits access to an object based on the owner of the object's decision. Common permissions include Read, Write, and Execute.

**Q: What are Access Control Lists (ACLs) used for in Discretionary Access Control?**
A: Access Control Lists (ACLs) are used in Discretionary Access Control to determine what traffic a network can send or receive.

**Q: How does Role-Based Access Control work?**
A: Role-Based Access Control is based on the role or function of an employee. It can work in combination with DAC or MAC.

**Q: What is Rule-Based Access Control?**
A: Rule-Based Access Control uses Access Control Lists (ACLs) and has rules that determine if access is granted or not. Factors that influence this decision include time of day, group membership, need to know, etc.

**Q: What are some examples of physical access control measures?**
A: Examples of physical access control measures include guards, fences, motion sensors, laptop locks, locked doors, guard dogs, video cameras, and more.

**Q: What is the purpose of administrative access control?**
A: Administrative access control involves policies, procedures, hiring practices, background checks, data classification based on sensitivity, security training, reviews, etc.

**Q: How does logical access control protect systems?**
A: Logical access control uses hardware and software solutions to manage access to systems. This includes methods like passwords, biometrics, and two-factor authentication.

**Q: Why is Role-Based Access Control useful in large organizations?**
A: Role-Based Access Control is beneficial in large organizations because it manages hundreds of users and potentially thousands of permissions more efficiently than other access control strategies.

**Q: What strategy based on security labels is discussed in this study material?**
A: The strategy that uses security labels (top secret, secret, confidential, and unclassified) is Mandatory Access Control.

**Q: What strategy in this study material is based on access control lists?**
A: The strategy that uses access control lists is Mandatory Access Control.

**Q: Why is Discretionary Access Control useful in organizations with many potential permissions?**
A: Discretionary Access Control is useful in organizations with many potential permissions because it allows the owner of the resource to decide who has access, which can be more manageable than other strategies in such environments.

**Q: How does Role-Based Access Control determine access based on an object's label and the user's label?**
A: In Role-Based Access Control, access is determined based on the security classification of the object (e.g., top secret) and the label assigned to the user.

**Q: What is a common strategy for securing systems that combines multiple access control methods?**
A: A common strategy for securing systems that combines multiple access control methods is one based on functions of employees, which may use Mandatory Access Control, Role-Based Access Control, Discretionary Access Control, and Rule-Based Access Control.
