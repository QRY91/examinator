# ðŸ¦  Malware & Deception - Clean Study Guide

## Malware Types

**Q: What is malware?**
A: Malicious software designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems.

**Q: What is a virus?**
A: Malware that requires a host file and user action to spread. Attaches itself to executable files and spreads when infected files are shared.

**Q: What is a worm?**
A: Self-replicating malware that spreads automatically across networks without user interaction. Can consume network bandwidth and system resources.

**Q: What is a Trojan horse?**
A: Malware disguised as legitimate software that performs hidden malicious functions when executed by the user.

**Q: What is ransomware?**
A: Malware that encrypts victim's files and demands payment (ransom) for the decryption key to restore access.

**Q: What is spyware?**
A: Malware that secretly monitors user activity, collecting information like keystrokes, passwords, browsing habits, and personal data.

**Q: What is adware?**
A: Software that displays unwanted advertisements, often bundled with legitimate programs. Can slow systems and track user behavior.

**Q: What is a rootkit?**
A: Malware that modifies the operating system to hide its presence and maintain persistent access to the system.

**Q: What is a logic bomb?**
A: Malicious code that remains dormant until triggered by a specific condition (date/time, user action, system event).

## Advanced Malware

**Q: What is a backdoor?**
A: Hidden method of bypassing normal authentication to gain system access, often installed by other malware.

**Q: What is a botnet?**
A: Network of infected computers (bots/zombies) controlled remotely by cybercriminals for coordinated attacks.

**Q: What is browser hijacking?**
A: Malware that modifies web browser settings to redirect users to malicious websites or display unwanted ads.

**Q: What is keylogging?**
A: Recording keystroke data to capture sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, and personal data.

## Social Engineering & Deception

**Q: What is phishing?**
A: Fraudulent emails/websites impersonating legitimate entities to steal sensitive information like credentials or financial data.

**Q: What is spear phishing?**
A: Targeted phishing attacks directed at specific individuals or organizations using personalized information.

**Q: What is whaling?**
A: Phishing attacks specifically targeting high-profile individuals like executives or celebrities.

**Q: What is vishing?**
A: Voice phishing - social engineering attacks conducted over the phone to extract sensitive information.

**Q: What is pretexting?**
A: Creating fabricated scenarios to build trust and convince victims to reveal information or perform actions.

**Q: What is baiting?**
A: Offering something enticing (free USB, download) that contains malware or leads to system compromise.

**Q: What is shoulder surfing?**
A: Observing someone enter passwords, PINs, or sensitive information by looking over their shoulder.

**Q: What is dumpster diving?**
A: Searching through trash to find documents containing sensitive information like passwords or personal data.

## Malware Distribution Methods

**Q: How is malware commonly distributed?**
A: Email attachments, infected websites, malicious downloads, USB drives, software vulnerabilities, and social engineering.

**Q: What are drive-by downloads?**
A: Automatic malware downloads that occur when visiting compromised websites, often without user knowledge.

**Q: What is a watering hole attack?**
A: Compromising websites frequently visited by target organizations to infect visitors with malware.

**Q: What are software vulnerabilities?**
A: Security flaws in programs that malware can exploit to gain system access without user interaction.

## Protection & Prevention

**Q: How can you protect against malware?**
A: Use antivirus software, keep systems updated, avoid suspicious emails/links, use firewalls, backup data regularly.

**Q: What is sandboxing?**
A: Running suspicious programs in isolated environments to analyze behavior without risking the main system.

**Q: What are indicators of compromise (IoCs)?**
A: Evidence that a system has been breached, such as unusual network traffic, file changes, or system behavior.

**Q: How do you respond to malware infection?**
A: Isolate system, identify malware type, remove infection, restore from backups, update security measures, document incident.

## Defense Strategies

**Q: What is defense in depth for malware protection?**
A: Using multiple security layers: endpoint protection, network security, user training, access controls, and monitoring.

**Q: What is behavioral analysis?**
A: Monitoring program behavior to detect malicious activities rather than relying solely on signature-based detection.

**Q: What is the importance of regular backups?**
A: Backups allow system restoration if infected by ransomware or destructive malware, reducing impact of attacks.
