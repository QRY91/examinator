<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity. This can be done by something they know (e.g., a password), something they have (e.g., a token or card), or something they are (e.g., a fingerprint).

</details>

### 9. What are the differences between Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting in AAA?

<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

Authentication is verifying a user's identity, Authorization is granting access to specific resources based on the verified user's identity, and Accounting is recording and storing actions taken by users for auditing purposes.

</details>

### 10. How can you control access to resources in a system?

<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

Access to resources in a system can be controlled using mechanisms such as Access Control Lists (ACL), chmod for Unix systems, or RMK > Properties > Security > Edit Permissions in Windows.

</details>

### 11. What is the purpose of Accounting in AAA?

<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

The purpose of Accounting in AAA is to register and store actions taken by users, such as what resources they accessed, how often, and what changes they made.

</details>

### 12. Why is it important to implement Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting in a system?

<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

Implementing Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting ensures the security of sensitive information, prevents unauthorized access, maintains the integrity of data, and enables auditing for accountability.

</details>

### 13. Explain Authorization in AAA.

<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

Authorization is the process of granting or denying a user access to specific resources based on their verified identity. This can be done using Access Control Lists (ACL) or system-specific mechanisms such as chmod for Unix systems and RMK > Properties > Security > Edit Permissions in Windows.

</details>

### 14. What is the role of Accounting in maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of a system?

<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

Accounting helps maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of a system by providing a record of actions taken by users, which can be used for auditing purposes to identify unauthorized access or modifications that could compromise the system's security.

</details>

### 15. Why is it important to register and store user actions in a system?

<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

Registering and storing user actions provides a historical record of who accessed what resources, how often, and what changes were made. This information can be useful for troubleshooting issues, identifying trends, and detecting potential security breaches or unauthorized access.
