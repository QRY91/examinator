## ðŸ“š Study Questions & Answers

### 1. What is the difference between cryptography and hashing?

<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

Cryptography is a technique used to hide or secure data or information, while hashing is a process of converting data into a fixed-size string of characters, often used for creating digital signatures, password storage, and message integrity checks.

</details>

### 2. What is cryptography in English?

<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

Cryptography is the technique of hiding or securing data or information. It can be translated to "Cryptografie" in Dutch.

</details>

### 3. Explain the difference between plaintext, encryption, key, decryption, and ciphertext.

<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

Plaintext refers to the original message that is sent. Encryption is the process of encoding the plaintext before it is sent. The result of encryption is ciphertext. A key, or secret code, is shared only between the sender and receiver. Decryption is the process of decoding the ciphertext into plaintext using the shared key.

</details>

### 4. What is symmetric encryption?

<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. This means that the sender and the receiver must share a secret key before they can exchange encrypted messages.

</details>

### 5. What is asymmetric encryption?

<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

Asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key cryptography, uses two keys - a public key and a private key. The public key is used for signing or encrypting messages, while the private key is used for decrypting them.

</details>

### 6. What is cryptoanalysis?

<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

Cryptoanalysis is the process of analyzing, studying, and breaking codes to gain unauthorized access to encrypted information.

</details>

### 7. What is the difference between cryptology, cryptography, and cryptoanalysis?

<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

Cryptology is the study of making and breaking codes. Cryptography is the practice of creating and using codes for secure communication. Cryptoanalysis is the process of analyzing, studying, and breaking codes to gain unauthorized access to encrypted information.

</details>

### 8. What is hashing often referred to as?

<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

Hashing is often referred to as one-way encryption because once data has been hashed, it cannot be reversed back to its original form.

</details>

### 9. Explain the concept of salting in encryption, hashing, and encoding.

<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

Salting involves adding random data before putting data through a cryptographic hash function. This helps prevent attacks such as dictionary attacks by making each hash output unique even for identical inputs.

</details>

### 10. What is the role of keys in symmetric and asymmetric encryption?

<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

In symmetric encryption, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. In asymmetric encryption, two different keys are used - a public key for encrypting messages and a private key for decrypting them.

</details>

### 11. Why do we use cryptography in cybersecurity?

<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

We use cryptography in cybersecurity to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data in transmission or storage.

</details>

### 12. What are some practical examples of the usage of encryption, hashing, and salting in real life?

<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

Encryption is used for securing sensitive data such as credit card information, personal messages, and emails. Hashing is used for creating digital signatures, password storage, and message integrity checks. Salting is used to add an extra layer of security to hashed passwords, making it harder for attackers to crack them using dictionary attacks.

</details>

### 13. What are the challenges in symmetric encryption compared to asymmetric encryption?

<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

The main challenge in symmetric encryption is securely sharing and managing keys between communicating parties. In contrast, asymmetric encryption does not require key management as each party has their own private key for decryption.

</details>

### 14. What are some potential threats to confidentiality and how can we mitigate them using cryptography?

<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤” Click to reveal answer</summary>

Potential threats to confidentiality include eavesdropping, interception, and unauthorized access. Cryptography provides a way to protect data from these threats by encrypting it before transmission or storage, ensuring that only authorized parties can access the information.
