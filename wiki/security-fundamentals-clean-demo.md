## 📚 Study Questions & Answers

### 1. What does CIA stand for in cybersecurity?

<details>
<summary>🤔 Click to reveal answer</summary>

Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability - the three fundamental principles of information security.

</details>

### 2. Define Confidentiality in the CIA Triad

<details>
<summary>🤔 Click to reveal answer</summary>

Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to access it. Prevents unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.

</details>

### 3. Define Integrity in the CIA Triad

<details>
<summary>🤔 Click to reveal answer</summary>

Ensuring that information is accurate, complete, and has not been modified by unauthorized parties.

</details>

### 4. Define Availability in the CIA Triad

<details>
<summary>🤔 Click to reveal answer</summary>

Ensuring that information and systems are accessible when needed by authorized users.

</details>

### 5. What is the difference between authentication and authorization?

<details>
<summary>🤔 Click to reveal answer</summary>

Authentication verifies WHO you are (identity verification), while authorization determines WHAT you can access (permission control).
## Cryptography Basics

</details>

### 6. What is the main difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?

<details>
<summary>🤔 Click to reveal answer</summary>

Symmetric uses the same key for encryption/decryption (faster, shared secret), while asymmetric uses different keys - public/private key pairs (slower, no shared secret needed).

</details>

### 7. What is RSA and what is it used for?

<details>
<summary>🤔 Click to reveal answer</summary>

RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm using public/private key pairs. Used for secure key exchange, digital signatures, and encrypting small amounts of data.

</details>

### 8. What is AES?

<details>
<summary>🤔 Click to reveal answer</summary>

Advanced Encryption Standard - a symmetric encryption algorithm that's fast and secure. Uses 128, 192, or 256-bit keys.

</details>

### 9. What is hashing and how is it different from encryption?

<details>
<summary>🤔 Click to reveal answer</summary>

Hashing is a one-way function that creates a fixed-size digest from input data. Unlike encryption, it cannot be reversed - used for data integrity verification.

</details>

### 10. What is HMAC?

<details>
<summary>🤔 Click to reveal answer</summary>

Hash-based Message Authentication Code - combines a hash function with a secret key to provide both data integrity and authentication.
## Network Security

</details>

### 11. What is a firewall?

<details>
<summary>🤔 Click to reveal answer</summary>

A network security device that monitors and controls incoming/outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

</details>

### 12. What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?

<details>
<summary>🤔 Click to reveal answer</summary>

HTTPS (HTTP Secure) adds TLS/SSL encryption to HTTP, protecting data in transit between client and server.

</details>

### 13. What is a VPN?

<details>
<summary>🤔 Click to reveal answer</summary>

Virtual Private Network - creates a secure, encrypted tunnel over the internet for private communication.
## Common Attacks

</details>

### 14. What is phishing?

<details>
<summary>🤔 Click to reveal answer</summary>

A social engineering attack using fake emails, websites, or messages to trick users into revealing sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers.

</details>

### 15. What is SQL injection?

<details>
<summary>🤔 Click to reveal answer</summary>

A web application attack where malicious SQL code is inserted into application queries, potentially allowing attackers to access/modify database data.

</details>

### 16. What is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?

<details>
<summary>🤔 Click to reveal answer</summary>

A web vulnerability where attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially stealing data or hijacking sessions.

</details>

### 17. What is a man-in-the-middle attack?

<details>
<summary>🤔 Click to reveal answer</summary>

An attack where the attacker intercepts and potentially alters communications between two parties who believe they're communicating directly.
## Malware Types

</details>

### 18. What is a virus vs. a worm?

<details>
<summary>🤔 Click to reveal answer</summary>

A virus requires a host file and user action to spread, while a worm can replicate and spread automatically across networks without user interaction.

</details>

### 19. What is ransomware?

<details>
<summary>🤔 Click to reveal answer</summary>

Malware that encrypts victim's files and demands payment (ransom) for the decryption key.

</details>

### 20. What is a Trojan horse?

<details>
<summary>🤔 Click to reveal answer</summary>

Malware disguised as legitimate software that performs hidden malicious functions when executed.
## Access Control

</details>

### 21. What is the principle of least privilege?

<details>
<summary>🤔 Click to reveal answer</summary>

Users should be given the minimum levels of access necessary to perform their job functions - nothing more.

</details>

### 22. What is multi-factor authentication (MFA)?

<details>
<summary>🤔 Click to reveal answer</summary>

Security method requiring two or more verification factors: something you know (password), something you have (token), something you are (biometric).

</details>

### 23. What is role-based access control (RBAC)?

<details>
<summary>🤔 Click to reveal answer</summary>

Access control method where permissions are assigned to roles, and users are assigned to roles based on their job functions.
## Incident Response

</details>

### 24. What are the four main phases of incident response?

<details>
<summary>🤔 Click to reveal answer</summary>

1) Preparation, 2) Detection & Analysis, 3) Containment, Eradication & Recovery, 4) Post-Incident Activity/Lessons Learned.

</details>

### 25. What should be the first priority during a security incident?

<details>
<summary>🤔 Click to reveal answer</summary>

Containment - prevent the incident from spreading or causing further damage while preserving evidence.
## Privacy & Compliance

</details>

### 26. What is data anonymization?

<details>
<summary>🤔 Click to reveal answer</summary>

The process of removing or altering personally identifiable information so individuals cannot be identified from the dataset.

</details>

### 27. What is k-anonymity?

<details>
<summary>🤔 Click to reveal answer</summary>

A privacy preservation technique ensuring each record is indistinguishable from at least k-1 other records based on quasi-identifiers.
